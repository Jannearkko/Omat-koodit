## Build a Tank

- Take the LAB2 project as a starting point
- Build a tank from three boxes
- Place the tank parts into the scenegraph so that the turret follows the base and the pipe follows the turret
- Perform simple controls:
    - Arrow keys left and right turns tank base
    - Arrow keys up and down move tank base forward and backward
    - 'A' and 'D' rotates turret to the left and right
    - 'W' and 'S' rotates pipe up and down

### See reference video [here](./lab02-reference.mp4)

Tips:
- You need to declare 3 Geometry objects, one for each piece of Tank.
- You can use one material to all Tank pieces.
- use IApplication::IsKeyDown function to check if certain key is pressed down. For example:

```
if (IsKeyDown(KEY_LEFT))
{
	// arrow key left is down
}

if (IsKeyDown('A'))
{
	// 'A' is down
}
```
