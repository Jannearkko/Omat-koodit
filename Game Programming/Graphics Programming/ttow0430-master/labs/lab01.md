## Gouraud shaded triangle

- Take the LAB1 project as a starting point.
- **Note:** Project compiles but will not run as shaders are not implemented.

- Introduce your own data type for triangle vertices
- Vertices should have a location (x, y, z) and a color (r, g, b)
- Convert vertices into a triangle with a red lower right corner, a green lower left corner and a blue tip
- Implement vertex and fragment shaders that draw a triangle on the screen
- Press the space bar to start rotating around the z axis
- Press the space bar again to stop rotation of the triangle
