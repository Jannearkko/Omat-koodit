# Graphics Programming

&nbsp;
## **The Core**
We use a 'minimum dependency' game engine *core* as a template for our graphics programming. This core engine is created during Game Engine Programming course, but we get to use it already.

Download and extract the *core* engine source files.
[Core Engine Source Files](../source/core/core.zip)

Download and extract the lesson01 zipped project to same folder with *core* source files.
[Lesson01 project](../source/lesson01/lesson01-start.zip)


Lets get familiar with *core* engine

## **Happy Coding!**
